BlackBerry's Z10 marks a major shift in the company's approach to smartphones. Sure, it previously tried to tackle the full touchscreen market with devices like the Storm, Torch, and PlayBook, but the Z10 is the first noteworthy attempt to compete with the likes of Apple, Google, and, to a degree, Microsoft in terms of features, specs, and mass appeal. BlackBerry's latest handset and completely revised OS were built from the ground up to attract the attention of the maturing smartphone market and, as the company struggles to compete for third place, both could be considered its last chance to return to its former glory. Keep reading to find out if the company has achieved its goal.

Samsung's Galaxy S3 was one of the most popular phones of last year, rivalled only by the iPhone. It played a huge role in unseating Apple's dominance of the mobile world, so all eyes have been on Samsung to see what it will bring to the table with its next super phone.
<br/>
After months of wild speculation, Samsung finally unveiled the S4 -- a phone boasting specs to make even the most ardent tech nerds draw breath. It's a 5-inch beast, packing a Full HD screen, a searingly powerful quad-core processor, 2GB of RAM, a host of Samsung software extras, a 13-megapixel camera and 4G connectivity for super-fast data speeds.

First 2 questions I get when someone sees this device: is that a phone? Does it fit in your pocket? No, its a blender. No, it doesn't fit in my pocket I have to wear a backpack to carry it around. But seriously, it is big for a phone, but it fits in every pocket of pants that I wear easily. I sold my Galaxy Tab 10.1 and my Galaxy S III for this phone. I hate the word phablet, but it is truly both. The screen size allows for all types of media consumption comfortably. The hardware along with JellyBean make the Note II the smoothest Android experience to date. I mean no slowdowns, stutters, or crashes of any kind. Besides having the functionality of a phone, you get many features including S-Pen and a great camera, which in combination makes for something special, and a big battery for the long trips.
<br/>
I am not an artist, but the S Pen makes it super easy to experiment with. It is really fun and easy (once you know about them) to explore through the features, although I do recommend downloading "User's Digest: Samsung Galaxy NoteII" from the Playstore. It is a basic, yet informative guide that takes you through many of the S-Pen features. And there are many!
